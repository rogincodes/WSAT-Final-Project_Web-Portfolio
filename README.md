# Web Portfolio - Web Systems and Technologies Final Project
## Website link: wsatfinalproject.infinityfreeapp.com
#### This web portfolio served as our final project. It is the compilation of activities we have completed in our Web Systems and Technologies course.

Note: It was my first time doing web development. So my codes are as messy as they can get, and the design is not very modern and aesthetic.

# Web Portfolio - Web Systems and Technologies Final Project
## Website link: https://rogincodes.github.io/WSAT-Final-Project_Web-Portfolio/
#### This web portfolio served as our final project. It is the compilation of activities we have completed in our Web Systems and Technologies course.

#### Tech used: HTML/CSS (the only techs we learned from this course)

Note: It was my first time with web development. So my codes are as messy as they can get, and the design is not very modern, and not responsive.

    <h2>Beef Kaldereta (Caldereta) is a popular Filipino dish that is served during parties and holidays. This version uses beef as the main protein and incorporates red bell peppers, carrots, potatoes and frozen peas.<h2>
</div>

    <ul>
    	<li>1 ½ lbs stewing beef cut into 1-inch cubes
		<li>½ cup vinegar

    <h2>Nutrition:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Calories: 621kcal</dt>
        		<dd>
        			The calorie is a unit of energy defined as the amount of heat needed to raise a quantity of water by one degree of temperature. There are two versions of the unit in use, which has led to some confusion.        		
    		<dt>Carbohydrates: 35g</dt>
				<dd>
					A carbohydrate is a biomolecule consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 and thus with the empirical formula Cₘₙ.   		
    	<dt>Protein: 52g</dt>
				<dd>
					Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much energy density as carbohydrates: 4 kcal per gram; in contrast, lipids provide 9 kcal per gram.
				
    	<dt>Fat: 29g</dt>
				<dd>
					In nutrition, fat usually means any ester of fatty acids, or a mixture of such compounds; most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food. 
				
    	<dt>Saturated Fat: 16g</dt>
				<dd>
					A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds. A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids. Fats are made of long chains of carbon atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds and others are linked by double bonds.
				
    	<dt>Cholesterol: 132mg</dt>
				<dd>
					Cholesterol is an organic molecule. It is a sterol, a type of lipid. Cholesterol is biosynthesized by all animal cells and is an essential structural component of animal cell membranes.
				
    	<dt>Sodium: 1734mg</dt>
				<dd>
					Is a mineral found in many foods. Your body needs sodium for normal muscle and nerve functions. It also helps keep body fluids in balance. Most table salts are made from sodium chloride. So, salt used when preparing or flavoring foods usually contains sodium.
				
    	<dt>Potassium: 1029mg</dt>
				<dd>
					Is a mineral that, among other things, helps muscles contract, helps regulate fluid and mineral balance in and out of body cells, and helps maintain normal blood pressure by limiting the effect of sodium. Potassium also may reduce the risk of recurrent kidney stones and bone loss as we age.
				
    	<dt>Fiber: 5g</dt> 
				<dd>
					Is a type of carbohydrate that the body can't digest. Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps regulate the body's use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check.
				
    	<dt>Sugar: 7g</dt> 
				<dd>
					Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Table sugar, granulated sugar, or regular sugar, refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose.
				
    	<dt>Vitamin A: 3885IU</dt> 
				<dd>
					Is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, including retinol, retinal, and retinyl esters. Vitamin A is involved in immune function, vision, reproduction, and cellular communication.
				
    	<dt>Vitamin C: 60.2mg </dt>
				<dd>
					Plays a role in controlling infections and healing wounds, and is a powerful antioxidant that can neutralize harmful free radicals. It is needed to make collagen, a fibrous protein in connective tissue that is weaved throughout various systems in the body: nervous, immune, bone, cartilage, blood, and others.
				
    	<dt>Calcium: 62mg</dt> 
				<dd>
					Is a mineral that people need to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. It is also very important for other physical functions, such as muscle control and blood circulation. Calcium is not made in the body — it must be absorbed from the foods we eat.
				
    	<dt>Iron: 7.9mg</dt>
    			<dd>
					Is a mineral, and its main purpose is to carry oxygen in the hemoglobin of red blood cells throughout the body so cells can produce energy. Iron also helps remove carbon dioxide.
